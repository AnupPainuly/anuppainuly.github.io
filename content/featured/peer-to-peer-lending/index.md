This report explores a loan dataset that comes from peer to peer lending marketplace with over \$7 billion in funded loans. Borrowers request personal loans on Prosper and investors (individual or institutional) can fund them. Investors can consider borrowersâ€™ credit scores, ratings, and histories and the category of the loan. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan and collects and distributes borrower payments and interest back to the loan investors.
