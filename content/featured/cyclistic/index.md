In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program with 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 stations in Chicago. Bikes are available for unlocking and returning at any station. Cyclistic initially focused on broad consumer awareness and flexible pricing: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Annual members are more profitable, and Cyclistic aims to convert casual riders into members. Moreno believes this is achievable, as casual riders are already aware of Cyclistic and have chosen it for their mobility needs. The focus now is on maximizing annual memberships for future growth.
