The Network Anomaly Detection System (NADS) project integrates Python programming and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for robust network security.
NADS comprises three core components: data collection, feature engineering, and anomaly detection.
Data collection involves gathering network traffic data through monitoring tools.
Python libraries are utilized to process raw packets and extract pertinent features from the data.
Extracted features serve as input for a range of ML algorithms, including classification and deep learning models.
These ML algorithms are trained on historical network data to discern normal patterns and behaviors.
