As data science and machine learning practitioners, we often find ourselves exploring diverse datasets to build and enhance our models. Kaggle, a hub for data enthusiasts, offers a plethora of datasets that can be invaluable for our projects. To streamline this process, the Kaggle API presents an efficient way to access your account. In this project I have built an automation for data acquisition using python to interact with Kaggle API.
