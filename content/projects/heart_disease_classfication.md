This project focuses on classifying heart disease based on various medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more. I have explored several machine learning models to predict the presence or absence of heart disease, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
